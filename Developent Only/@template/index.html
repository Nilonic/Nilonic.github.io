        <p>"@template" is a forbidden directory. It is reserved for development purposes only and should not be accessed. Accessing this directory may lead to unfinished or broken pages.</p>
        <p>If you are the owner of this directory, we recommend accessing it through your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or the hosting platform's page (e.g., GitHub) for proper management and to ensure the integrity of your project.</p>
        <p>If you are testing this locally, you may need to enter the full file path. For example, if the file is located at <code>~/website/Development Only/@template/template_index.html</code>, you can try accessing it using the following URL: <code>0.0.0.0:8000/Development Only/@template/template_index.html</code>.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can consider relocating the necessary files to a different directory accessible by the public to ensure proper functionality of your website.</p>
